## 策略

### 同位语从句前置

使用一个抽象名词概括整个句子，将实际的意思使用同位语从句表达。

> [!example] 人们越来越不重视读书。
> There is an alarmingly truth that an increasing number of individuals have developed a bad habit that they are paying less attention in reading.

### 同位语从句后置

使用一个抽象名词概括整个句子，在描述完想要表达的内容后，通过同位语从句后置概括性的补充。可以在最后再配合一个定语从句，使得句子表达的意思更加丰富。

> [!example] 随着科技的繁荣，年轻人越来越对父母不耐烦。
> Living in the science and technology strongly developed society, a phenomenon that youngsters are more and more solitary and appeals little patience with their parents.

### 动名词

> [!example] 如果我们在日常生活中骑共享单车，那么就可以减少温室效应。
> Riding sharing bikes in our daily life will reduce the green house effect.

### 独立主格

*随着...* 或者*因为...所以...* 可以尝试使用独立主格来丰富句子的结构。

> [!example] 学生喜欢做一些轻松的事情，所以做令人头疼的作业绝不是首要任务。
> Students tending to do things that could make them feel relaxed, doing homework wrecking their brains is not top priority.

> [!example] 因为大城市充满了机会，所以大学毕业生喜欢去一线城市创业。
> Opportunities abounding in the metropolis, college graduates are drawn to top tier cities to start their business, the driver for economic growth.

### 被动语态

用于多个句子中的主语重复出现时，可以利用被动语态，同时省略主语。

> [!example] 我建议每天读一篇文章
> Reading an article once a day is also advised.

### 建议信/请求信

Dear Sir or Madam,

As a student of university and a frequent user who spend a lot of time in local library, I am writing for the purpose of suggesting a way to improve library's service.

To begin with, I greatly appreciate the library’s rich collection of books ranging from science to literature. However, I have noticed that some of the facilities are outdated, which may hinder the overall user experience. I strongly recommend upgrading the library's equipment, such as chairs, desks, and lighting systems. Improved facilities would not only create a more comfortable environment for students but also simplify the work of librarians. Furthermore, I suggest extending the library’s opening hours during exam periods to better accommodate students' needs. Many students, including myself, often find the current schedule insufficient for effective preparation.

Thank you for considering my suggestions. I truly admire the hard work of the library staff and look forward to seeing these improvements implemented.
<p style="text-align: right">
Yours sincerely,<br>
Li Ming
</p>

### 温室花朵

==This is a thought-provoking and meaningful illustration==. In the first image, a delicate flower thrives vibrantly under the protection of a greenhouse. In the second image, the same flower, exposed to a storm without any shelter, quickly withers away.

Although the flower appears strong and vibrant in the greenhouse, this strength is merely an illusion created by the sheltered environment. Flowers nurtured in such conditions never develop the resilience needed to withstand harsh weather. When the protection is removed, their vulnerability is revealed, and they perish. ==This illustration metaphorically conveys an important truth==: children need to face challenges and setbacks to build resilience and develop the strength to overcome future adversities.

In my view, ==the illustration highlights the consequences of== overprotective parenting. Parents who shield their children from failure and provide excessive convenience may inadvertently hinder their growth. Setback education ==is crucial in fostering== children's perseverance and equipping them with the ability to navigate difficulties. It not only strengthens their determination but also teaches them how to handle failures constructively, an essential skill in today’s competitive world.

In conclusion, flowers raised in a greenhouse cannot survive in harsh environments. ==Similarly==, overprotected children are unlikely to thrive in a world filled with challenges. ==This is the profound message conveyed by the illustration.==

> 4. `Something` is crucial in fostering `somebody's ability`, as they `do something`.

> 这是一个发人深省且意义深远的插图。^[表达图片的意义，使用 "thought-provoking" 和 "meaningful" 形容。] 第一幅图中，一朵娇嫩的花在温室保护下茁壮成长。^[描述第一幅图，关键词是“delicate flower”和“thrives vibrantly”。] 第二幅图中，同一朵花失去保护，暴露在风雨中迅速枯萎。^[描述对比场景，重点是“exposed to a storm”和“withers away”。]

### 结束是新的开始

The illustration features an excited man running across the finish line. On the ground, two arrows with Chinese characters can be translated as "The end is also a beginning."

The message of the illustration, "The end is a beginning", challenges the notion that one failure or success defines our entire life. Setting temporary goals and achieving them step by step is undoubtedly constructive. But the influence of those so-called ends would be overestimated.

In my view, what seems crucial now may become just a distant memory in ten or 20 years. Therefore, the most essential thing is to give out the utmost effort to achieve our goals. ==What truly matters is the== unforgettable experience we gain and the skills we acquire along the way. Once a goal is achieved, it is time to embrace new challenges in the next phase.

In conclusion, the profound message conveyed by the illustration serves as a reminder that life is a marathon, requiring persistence and continuous effort.

### 主题词：精神品质

Mental spirit plays a crucial role in success. Different missions require various types of qualities, which serve as a guide for individuals to grow and progress in society. To illustrate the importance of these qualities, I will discuss three examples: thrift, persistence, and teamwork.

Thrift, ==increasingly recognized as a crucial virtue amid growing environmental awareness==, helps reduce pollution, save energy, and repair the damage we have caused to the planet. Moreover, it is an easy practice that everyone can adopt. Small actions, such as turning off unused appliances or cycling instead of driving, can make a significant difference.

Another vital quality is persistence. History is filled with examples proving that perseverance is the key to success. This spirit ==is equally important in academic life==. Only by accumulating knowledge consistently can we overcome difficulties and improve our capabilities.

Last but not least, teamwork is fundamental to achieving success. Personal limitations and a lack of insight often hinder progress, but these can be overcome by collaborating with others. Compared to working alone, forming a team allows individuals to complement each other's weaknesses and generate diverse ideas, ultimately leading to greater achievements.

In conclusion, with these valuable qualities, we can advance steadily and confidently, building the competence needed to face future challenges and succeed in life.

### 主题词：道德

This is a thought-provoking and meaningful illustration. A young man is picking up a piece of litter and putting it into a trash bin, an action that inspires admiration and reflection from passersby. Below the image is the phrase, “Small actions reflect great virtues.”

What this young man’s action reminds me of is that our government has long advocated for public virtues. Although the spirit of keeping the environment clean is not emphasized as much as before, this young man’s action vividly responds to the government’s expectations and serves as an example for others.

However, challenges such as littering still persist. To better promote the spread of virtues, two suggestions can be made. First, cultivating good habits requires consistent attention to small daily actions. Only through persistent self-discipline can we nurture prudence and virtuous character. Second, seeking feedback and supervision from others can help us not only regulate our actions but also improve interpersonal skills and foster a collective sense of responsibility.

In conclusion, the virtues demonstrated by the young man serve as a paradigm that we all should follow. By raising awareness, such actions can positively influence not only ourselves but also those around us, paving the way for a cleaner and more harmonious society.
