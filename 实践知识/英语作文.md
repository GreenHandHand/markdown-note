## 策略

### 同位语从句前置

使用一个抽象名词概括整个句子，将实际的意思使用同位语从句表达。

> [!example] 人们越来越不重视读书。
> There is an alarmingly truth that an increasing number of individuals have developed a bad habit that they are paying less attention in reading.

### 同位语从句后置

### 建议信/请求信

Dear Sir or Madam,

As a student of university and a frequent user who spend a lot of time in local library, I am writing for the purpose of suggesting a way to improve library's service.

To begin with, I greatly appreciate the library’s rich collection of books ranging from science to literature. However, I have noticed that some of the facilities are outdated, which may hinder the overall user experience. I strongly recommend upgrading the library's equipment, such as chairs, desks, and lighting systems. Improved facilities would not only create a more comfortable environment for students but also simplify the work of librarians. Furthermore, I suggest extending the library’s opening hours during exam periods to better accommodate students' needs. Many students, including myself, often find the current schedule insufficient for effective preparation.

Thank you for considering my suggestions. I truly admire the hard work of the library staff and look forward to seeing these improvements implemented.
<p style="text-align: right">
Yours sincerely,<br>
Li Ming
</p>

### 温室花朵

==This is a thought-provoking and meaningful illustration==. In the first image, a delicate flower thrives vibrantly under the protection of a greenhouse. In the second image, the same flower, exposed to a storm without any shelter, quickly withers away.

Although the flower appears strong and vibrant in the greenhouse, this strength is merely an illusion created by the sheltered environment. Flowers nurtured in such conditions never develop the resilience needed to withstand harsh weather. When the protection is removed, their vulnerability is revealed, and they perish. ==This illustration metaphorically conveys an important truth==: children need to face challenges and setbacks to build resilience and develop the strength to overcome future adversities.

In my view, ==the illustration highlights the consequences of== overprotective parenting. Parents who shield their children from failure and provide excessive convenience may inadvertently hinder their growth. Setback education ==is crucial in fostering== children's perseverance and equipping them with the ability to navigate difficulties. It not only strengthens their determination but also teaches them how to handle failures constructively, an essential skill in today’s competitive world.

In conclusion, flowers raised in a greenhouse cannot survive in harsh environments. ==Similarly==, overprotected children are unlikely to thrive in a world filled with challenges. ==This is the profound message conveyed by the illustration.==

> 3. This highlight the `importance/consequences` of `something`.
> 4. `Something` is crucial in fostering `somebody's ability`, as they `do something`.

### 结束是新的开始

The illustration features an excited man running across the finish line. On the ground, two arrows with Chinese characters can be translated as "The end is also a beginning."

The message of the illustration, "The end is a beginning", challenges the notion that one failure or success defines our entire life. Setting temporary goals and achieving them step by step is undoubtedly constructive. But the influence of those so-called ends would be overestimated.

In my view, what seems crucial now may become just a distant memory in ten or 20 years. Therefore, the most essential thing is to give out the utmost effort to achieve our goals. ==What truly matters is the== unforgettable experience we gain and the skills we acquire along the way. Once a goal is achieved, it is time to embrace new challenges in the next phase.

In conclusion, the profound message conveyed by the illustration serves as a reminder that life is a marathon, requiring persistence and continuous effort.

> 3. What truly matters is `somthing`.

### 主题词：精神品质

Mental spirit plays a crucial role in success. Different missions require various types of qualities, which serve as a guide for individuals to grow and progress in society. To illustrate the importance of these qualities, I will discuss three examples: thrift, persistence, and teamwork.

Thrift, ==increasingly recognized as a crucial virtue amid growing environmental awareness==, helps reduce pollution, save energy, and repair the damage we have caused to the planet. Moreover, it is an easy practice that everyone can adopt. Small actions, such as turning off unused appliances or cycling instead of driving, can make a significant difference.

Another vital quality is persistence. History is filled with examples proving that perseverance is the key to success. This spirit ==is equally important in academic life==. Only by accumulating knowledge consistently can we overcome difficulties and improve our capabilities.

Last but not least, teamwork is fundamental to achieving success. Personal limitations and a lack of insight often hinder progress, but these can be overcome by collaborating with others. Compared to working alone, forming a team allows individuals to complement each other's weaknesses and generate diverse ideas, ultimately leading to greater achievements.

In conclusion, with these valuable qualities, we can advance steadily and confidently, building the competence needed to face future challenges and succeed in life.

> [!note]
> 1. History proves that `quality` is the key to success.

### 主题词：道德

This is a thought-provoking and meaningful illustration. A young man is picking up a piece of litter and putting it into a trash bin, an action that inspires admiration and reflection from passersby. ==Below the image is the phrase==, “Small actions reflect great virtues.”

==What this young man’s action reminds me of is that== our government has long advocated for public virtues. Although the spirit of keeping the environment clean is not emphasized as much as before, this young man’s action vividly responds to the government’s expectations and serves as an example for others.

However, challenges such as littering still persist. To better promote the spread of virtues, two suggestions can be made. First, cultivating good habits requires consistent attention to small daily actions. ==Only through persistent self-discipline can we== nurture prudence and virtuous character. Second, seeking feedback and supervision from others can help us not only regulate our actions but also improve interpersonal skills and foster a collective sense of responsibility.

In conclusion, ==the virtues demonstrated by the young man serve as a paradigm that we all should follow==. By raising awareness, such actions can positively influence not only ourselves but also those around us, ==paving the way for== a cleaner and more harmonious society.

> [!note]
> 1. What something reminds me of is that somebody do something.
> 2. Only through something can we do something.
> 3. Something demonstrated by somebody serves as a paradigm that we all should follow.
> 4. pave the way for something.

### 主题词：家庭

This is a thought-provoking and meaningful illustration. In the image, a child and their parents are sitting around a table, sharing a meal. The relaxed and harmonious atmosphere is evident from their expressions. The subject of the image is “a warm family dinner nourishes both body and soul.”

Indeed, although the food appears simple and frugal, the people enjoying it display a great sense of happiness and fulfillment. ==As the remark of the illustration suggests==, individual objects hold less value than the integration of a family’s warmth, which nourishes both the body and the soul.

In my view, I strongly agree with the message conveyed by the illustration. History has shown that children raised in a cold and indifferent environment are more likely to commit crimes or harm themselves. Therefore, it is crucial to fill a child’s upbringing with warm and joyful moments, which can provide comfort and strength during future challenges. Moreover, lighthearted communication with children is highly recommended. This not only cheers them up but also allows parents to release their own stress. Effective communication builds a bridge between parents and children, fosters mutual understanding, and strengthens family bonds.

In conclusion, what truly warms a family is integration, consideration, and care, even if it is reflected in the simplest everyday acts. This is the profound message conveyed by the illustration.

### 主题词：健康成长

This is a thought-provoking and meaningful illustration. In the image, a kid is climbing. What brace the climber are two words "healthy body" and "positive attitude", and the terminal of the stairs is named as life goals. The child seems determined and persistent, with the sun named as family support and educational guidance surrounding them.

This illustration highlights four things that children require to achieve their life goals. In my opinion, a healthy body and a positive attitude are the intrinsic motivators serving as drivers of individuals' progression. Meanwhile, family support and educational guidance act as the light towers that guide kids through the complex world. Only if all these conditions combine together can children obtain the inevitable qualities to reach the goals of their lives.

As a college student nourished in the same environment, I hold a strong compliment with this subject. As far as I'm concerned, most of the virtues needed for success are developed under such circumstances. When we face annoying trouble or fall into failure, it is the competence built from the four requirements that provides us with constructive navigation through frustration and failure. Therefore, nurturing children as the illustration suggested is recommended for parents who anticipate their children to succeed.

In conclusion, the childhood environment characterizes the competence of individuals, a compass that leads them to life goals. What parents are supposed to do is raise kids' awareness of the healthy body and the positive attitude, offering them family support and education guidance. That is the profound message that the illustration conveys.

> [!note] 优秀表达
> 1. Healthy body and positive attitude are the ==intrinsic motivators driving personal growth==.
> 2. Family support and educational guidance ==act as beacons, illuminating the path== in a complex world.
> 3. The childhood environment ==shapes== an individual’s competence, serving as a compass that guides them toward their life goals.

### 主题词：文化

This is a thought-provoking and meaningful illustration. In the image, a traditional calligrapher is demonstrating Chinese writing. In the background, a foreign audience is taking photos, with amazement and delight on his face. The caption of the image reads, "Cultural exchange enriches our understanding of the world."

This illustration highlights the significance of cultural exchange. There is no doubt that cultures in the world are innumerable. Different civilizations have nourished unique customs and traditions, which are deeply influenced by the local environment and history. Moreover, cultures have evolved to meet the needs of human survival, serving as a way to adapt to and protect against challenges such as diseases and natural disasters.

In my view, I strongly agree with this notion. Living in such a fast-paced and rapidly evolving world, it is diverse cultures that ease burdens and mend cracks in people's mental worlds. Therefore, we should embrace great cultures from other countries while spreading the essence of our own. Only by absorbing the beneficial aspects of others and inheriting the practical wisdom of our own traditions can we navigate the course of historical development.

In conclusion, as the phrase suggests, learning from diverse cultures can enhance our understanding of the world and develop our own cultures at the same time. That is the profound message conveyed by the illustration.

### 主题词：新文化与旧文化

This is a thought-provoking and significant illustration. In the chart, the proportion of youngsters who engage in traditional cultures such as calligraphy, folk dancing and traditional music is decreasing every year. Meanwhile, modern cultures, including gaming and social media-related content creating, developed rapidly in the past few years.

This illustration highlights an alarming truth that adolescents are more fond of "current culture". However, there are some racial critics that we should prevent children from electronic products which not only do harm to kids' physical and mental health but also occupy the space of traditional cultures. For instance, there are a lot of kids addicted to digital games every year.

From my perspective, I find myself in complete disagreement with it. Traditional and modern cultures are inevitable compositions of human civilization. Modern cultures are more recognized by teenagers because of their extent and freestyle, which is not conflicted with the essence of traditions. Therefore, what we should do is to combine them. For example, exhibiting traditional arts through digital games, like black myth: wukong, is an appropriate and appreciated method which won tremendous compliment on the Chinese Internet. Only through such refreshing ways can we build a stable bridge between modern and traditional cultures, which serves as an opportunity for youngsters to recognize these ancient stories.

In conclusion, as the chart displays, it is required to take actions which nurture the generations in an exchanged environment of traditional and modern cultures. This is the profound message the illustration conveys.

> [!note] With Chatgpt
> This is a thought-provoking and meaningful chart. It illustrates a declining trend in the proportion of young people engaging in traditional cultural activities, such as calligraphy, folk dancing, and traditional music, while participation in modern cultural activities like gaming and social media content creation has surged significantly over the past two decades.
>
> This trend highlights a crucial issue: the diminishing interest in traditional culture among adolescents. Some argue that electronic products should be restricted for young people, as excessive exposure not only harms their physical and mental health but also crowds out opportunities to appreciate traditional culture. For instance, the growing number of teenagers addicted to digital games each year exemplifies this concern.
>
> From my perspective, I disagree with completely opposing modern culture. Traditional and modern cultures are integral parts of human civilization, and they can coexist harmoniously. The appeal of modern culture lies in its freedom and creativity, which do not inherently conflict with the essence of tradition. Therefore, efforts should be made to integrate the two. For example, promoting traditional arts through digital games, such as the success of Black Myth: Wukong, is an innovative way to engage the younger generation with cultural heritage. Only by adopting such creative approaches can we build a bridge between modern and traditional cultures, enabling teenagers to appreciate and embrace their cultural roots.
>
> In conclusion, as the chart indicates, actions must be taken to foster a balanced environment where traditional and modern cultures thrive together. This is the profound message conveyed by the chart.

### 主题词：教育读书类

This is a thought-provoking and meaningful illustration. In the image, a teacher vividly demonstrates a principle from a book, while students listen intently. In front of each student lies the same book, symbolizing their shared engagement in learning. Below the image is the phrase, "Reading shapes minds, education changes lives."

This illustration highlights the significance of education and reading, which occupy a vital position in a country's development. Reading is one of the most efficient ways for individuals to understand the world, as demonstrated by the practices of great scientists and artists. Furthermore, the essence of education lies in cultivating insight and shaping mindsets, enabling individuals to tackle tasks and challenges constructively.

From my perspective, I find myself in complete agreement with the idea that reading and education are deeply intertwined. Therefore, it is crucial to integrate reading into educational practices. For instance, children should be encouraged to embrace reading during their compulsory education years. Only through appropriate guidance can reading develop into an intrinsic habit, which is precisely what education aims to foster. Furthermore, keeping libraries open and accessible is highly recommended, as providing ample opportunities for reading is a practical way to cultivate this habit.

In conclusion, education is a guiding star that leads individuals to life achievements, ==while reading serves as a cornerstone paving the way to success==. This is the profound message the illustration conveys.

> [!note] 积累
> - intertwined: 交织
> - something serves as a cornerstone paving the way to something.
> - For example -> For instance
> - something serves as pillars of adj progress.
> - Only by embracing `something` can we `do somehting` and create a sustainable world.

### 主题词：经济发展类

This is a thought-provoking and meaningful illustration. In the chart, the economy of the region shows rapid growth. ==Beneath the economic growth curve== are two lines, representing the hospital coverage rate and residents' happiness index, ==both of which== steadily rise ==alongside== economic development. Below the image is the phrase, "Economic growth and social progress go hand in hand."

This illustration highlights the pivotal role of economic growth as a driving force behind advancements in healthcare and cultural development. There is no doubt that economic indicators such as GDP are fundamental to national progress. Moreover, history has shown that only a prosperous and well-governed nation can provide high-quality and accessible social welfare for its citizens.

From my perspective, I completely agree with the notion that economic growth and social progress are ==interconnected==. To sustain this harmonious development, continuous efforts must be made to prioritize economic expansion as a national mission. Furthermore, ==on an individual level==, pursuing a fulfilling career and maintaining lifelong learning are practical approaches to contributing to both personal and national advancement.

In conclusion, as the phrase suggests, economic growth serves as a guiding force for social progress, while societal prosperity reflects the success of economic development. This profound message emphasizes the need for balanced and sustained efforts to achieve mutual advancement.

### 主题词：保护环境

This is a significant and thought-provoking illustration. In the image, a tree has fallen, leaving people panicked and distressed. Some individuals are trying to save it, while others seem to be further damaging its roots. Below the image is the phrase, “Protecting the environment and saving the future."

The illustration highlights the significance and urgency of environmental protection. The environment serves as one of the fundamental pillars of economic and social development, providing essential resources and stability. Therefore, it is crucial to raise public awareness of environmental conservation.

From my perspective, I completely agree with the idea that everyone should take action to reduce environmental pollution. For instance, the government should play a leading role in promoting and encouraging a sustainable lifestyle among citizens. Moreover, reducing the use of gasoline-powered vehicles is also recommended, a measure that can not only benefit public health but also significantly improve air quality.

In conclusion, environmentally friendly practices serve as a cornerstone for building a sustainable and harmonious future, a vision that requires active participation from everyone. This is the profound message the illustration conveys.
